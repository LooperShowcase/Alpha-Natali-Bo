          <h1><p> what is intel?</p></h1>
          <h2><p>Intel Corporation (commonly known as Intel) is an American multinational corporation and<br> technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. </p></h2>
           <h1> <p> the Beginnings of Intel</p></h1>
           <h2><p> Intel was founded in July 1968 by American engineers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore.<br> Unlike the archetypal Silicon Valley start-up business with its fabled origins in a youthful founder’s garage,<br> Intel opened its doors with $2.5 million in funding arranged by Arthur Rock, the American financier who coined the term venture capitalist.</p></h2>
           <h1><p> what is the early products?</p></h1>
           <h2><p> Intel’s initial products were memory chips, including the world’s first metal oxide semiconductor  the 1101,<br> which did not sell well. However, its sibling, the 1103, a one-kilobit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip,<br> was successful and the first chip to store a significant amount of information. </p></h2>
